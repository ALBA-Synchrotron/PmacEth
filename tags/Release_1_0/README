Here you will find information how to compile and use PmacEth device server:

PmacEth device server supports only linux platform, 
and is compatible with Pmac2 and Turbo Pmac2 motion controllers
It requires tango libraries (and includes - for compilation).  

1. Compilation of communication library
	In comm_lib directory execute make command.

2. Compilation of device server.
	Makefile uses SICILIA environment variable as a root place of tango system. 
	SICILIA name comes from internal ALBA development configuration, 
	and will be change soon to TANGO_HOME. For the moment please treat it as TANGO_HOME 
	and forgive me that:)
	TANGO_HOME(SICILIA) environment variable points to tango system home.
	It requires at least following directory structure:

	TANGO_HOME 
	|---include     (subdirectory with tango, omniORB include files)
	|---lib         (subdirectory with tango, omniORG shared libraries)

3. Configuration of PmacEth device server in Tango Database.
	In database create device server PmacEth instance, with one device of class PmacEth.
	Add device property IP_address with value corresponding to ip of the controller.

4. Start your server. 

5. Device will be OFF state until you call OpenCommunication command. 
	After that, you can enjoy work with PmacEth device server:)
